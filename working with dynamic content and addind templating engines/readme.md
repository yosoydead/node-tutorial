* All the initial files were provided by the instructor. It is the same stuff from "understanding the basics" but with a bit more style. Also, the code is not commented.   
* Templating engines added: ejs, pug and express-handlebars.  
* Rendering with pug: [entire page rendered](https://i.imgur.com/l7uYQC9.png) and this is the [terminal with containing elements](https://i.imgur.com/P5WS2FY.png). It is fun and simple to use and I like it. I rendered every page with pug and I also made it so that it uses a layout so that I don't repeat too much code and also made it so that it sets the active class on a link.
